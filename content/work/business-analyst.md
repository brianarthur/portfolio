## Work Description
Spent the summer as an intern with Bell Canada IT Digital Customer Experience (DCX) team. Analyzed existing release workflows and environment datasets containing over 1000 records. Created a plan to migrate existing datasets into a new tool with improved tracking and improved reporting.

Developed a small DCX Tracking application as the sole developer, an in-house custom progressive web app (PWA) using React, to provide enhanced visual statistics to company directors. Much of my time was spent learning new systems and processes at a new company and independtly learning new technologies and frameworks. By the end of the summer I was able to understand some of the business requirements and make design decisions to improve the application.

Some of the technologies used for the PWA include:
- React
- Node JS
- Material UI
- Google Charts
- Lighthouse

Features of the application I developed include:
- View list information of releases, projects, and environemnts in multiple views including tabular lists and timeline charts
- Create filters and searches to view subsets of list data
- Ability to add new records or import existing CSV lists to populate the app
- Admin section to configure permissions of user groups

Created a working proof a concept solution by the end of year to present to company directors. Considered feedback and obtained the resources to expand the application the following year.
