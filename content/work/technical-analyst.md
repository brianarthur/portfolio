## Work Desctiption 
Second year back as a summer intern with Bell Canada IT Digital Customer Experience (DCX) team. Continued with the DCX Tracker application from the previous to continue development and offer increased benefits to the team. 

This summer saw an increase in the size of our development team and requirements of the application. During the year we aquired the resoures to host the application on a production ready server. Required that I maintain production ready and well documented source code with more developers working on the project. 

I worked closely with the release team as a client to understand the business requirements needed from the team. We would have weekly meetings to update on the progress, discuss any issues and plan out work required going forward. 

I also worked on integrating external tools to display optimized test flow automation (OTFA) to actively understand current release test status with increased data visualization. Worked on creating a server script to access REST APIs and save results into our SQL database, then creating a React dashboard to visualize and interact with the test data.

Improvements I made to the application this year:
- Script to query the test APIs and save into our database
- Create a dashboard with React to view current status of a release tests
- Feature for the release team to add status reasons and comments for test results

Being a returning student allowed me to take on more responsibility and take leadership on the onboarding of a new student to our team.
