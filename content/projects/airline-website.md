## Course Decription
This course was an introduction to Database Management Systems learning Structured Query Language (SQL). 

Course topics covered include:
- ER Models
- Relational Models
- Relaional Algebra
- SQL Queries
- Indexing
- Database Security
- plus many more!

## Project Description
During the final month of the course we were given an airport scenerio which required students to create well defined relational models in MySQL. We were then tasked with creating a website interface using PHP, CSS, and JavaScript ehich allowed users to execute simple tasks including viewing specific flights and adding/updating existing flights.

The requirements of this project were pretty simple as the course focus was the database systems. Project requirements include:
- Well defined SQL relational models
- Use of PHP Data Objects(PDO) to acccess the database layers
- Use of SQL queries to view specific flight information
- Ability to add and update existing flights through website interface and SQL queries

## Strech Goals
I decided to add some stretch goals for myself for a more challenging project. The goals that I accompished in this project include:
- Professional looking website with easy understanding and navigation using strictly CSS and JavaScript
- Form validation using JavaScript and fetching valid inputs through requests to PHP pages and SQL queries
- Good code documentation with ability to easily add pages/functionality that fit into the project and theme of the website
